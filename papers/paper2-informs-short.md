## 1. Problem and Motivation

Marketing classification tasks — conversion prediction, churn, response modeling — routinely operate with positive rates below 1%. At 0.2% positive rate and 8,000 training rows, a classifier trains on roughly 16 positive examples per split. Synthetic data augmentation is widely proposed as a remedy, but practitioners lack evidence on *when* it helps and *which generator* to use. Aggregate benchmarks (Erickson et al., 2025; Davila et al., 2025) rank generators across heterogeneous tasks and provide no guidance for the extreme-imbalance regime specific to marketing.

Table 1 makes the bottleneck concrete. Datasets with fewer than ~100 minority examples show large augmentation gains; those with 200+ show negligible gains. This is not a class-imbalance story per se — it is a **minority-example scarcity** story.

**Table 1 — Minority-example budget and baseline AUC by dataset**

| Dataset | Positive Rate | Train Rows | Minority Examples | Baseline AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Criteo Display | 0.2% | 8,000 | **16** | 0.846 ± 0.228 |
| Hillstrom Email | 0.9% | 8,000 | **72** | 0.548 ± 0.092 |
| German Credit | 30.0% | 800 | 240 | 0.794 ± 0.044 |
| Bank Marketing | 11.7% | 12,000 | 1,404 | 0.928 ± 0.004 |
| Telco Churn | 26.6% | 5,626 | 1,497 | 0.844 ± 0.015 |
| Nomao Lead | 28.3% | 8,000 | 2,264 | 0.991 ± 0.001 |

## 2. Experimental Setup

We evaluate five generators across seven datasets spanning positive rates from 0.2% to 30%: GaussianCopula (Patki et al., 2016), CTGAN (Xu et al., 2019), SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002), TabDDPM (Kotelnikov et al., 2023), and GReaT (Borisov et al., 2023) at two LLM scales (GPT-2 117M and Mistral-7B 7B). Protocol: 80/20 stratified split, α-sweep over {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0}, 5, 10 seeds, GradientBoostingClassifier primary downstream model (Friedman, 2001; Pedregosa et al., 2011), extended to four classifier families for robustness. Primary metric: AUC-ROC.

## 3. Core Finding: Minority-Example Scarcity Drives Augmentation Value

On the five datasets with 240+ minority examples (positive rate ≥ 11.7%), no generator exceeds +0.27 AUC points across any α value. On the two marketing datasets — Hillstrom (72 examples) and Criteo (16 examples) — CTGAN and SMOTE deliver +5.7 to +12.9 AUC points. A cross-dataset regression of best CTGAN gain on log(positive rate) yields R²=0.92 (directional, n=6). The 1%–10% positive-rate region is not represented in this regression and should not be inferred from it.

A striking illustration: on Criteo, 7 of 10 MLP seeds failed to converge using real data alone (AUC < 0.15). After CTGAN augmentation, all 10 seeds converged (mean AUC 0.940). Augmentation in this regime is not a marginal improvement; it is the difference between a working classifier and one that fails to train.

**Table 2 — Synthetic positive rate by generator (5 seeds × 8,000 generated rows)**

| Generator | Hillstrom synthetic rate | Criteo synthetic rate | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real training data | 0.90% | 0.30% | — |
| GaussianCopula | 0.96% ± 0.12% | 0.32% ± 0.06% | Mirrors real — no enrichment |
| TabDDPM | 0.89% ± 0.05% | 0.33% ± 0.09% | Mirrors real — no enrichment |
| **CTGAN** | **6.34% ± 0.21%** | **26.76% ± 1.18%** | **7–89× minority enrichment** |
| SMOTE | 100% (minority only) | 100% (minority only) | Minority targeted by design |

Table 2 directly explains the performance gap. GaussianCopula and TabDDPM sample at the natural positive rate — at 0.2% positive rate, this means 99.8% of generated rows are negative class, providing no minority enrichment. CTGAN's conditional vector generates 7–89× more positive-class rows than the training distribution. The mechanism is measurable and not inferred.

CTGAN also outperforms `class_weight='balanced'` reweighting by +7.55 AUC points on both datasets (measured directly under the same 5-seed protocol).

## 4. TabDDPM vs CTGAN

TabDDPM is the current state-of-the-art generator on general tabular benchmarks (Davila et al., 2025). We evaluate it at two training budgets: N_iter=2,000 (default) and N_iter=10,000 (5× extended). On both Hillstrom and Criteo, CTGAN outperforms TabDDPM at both budgets. Extended training widens the gap: TabDDPM at 10k goes uniformly negative on Hillstrom (all α values below baseline). The CTGAN advantage at extended training reaches d_z=1.25 on Hillstrom (p=0.049).

Table 2 explains why: TabDDPM samples unconditionally at the natural positive rate. Increasing training budget did not alter the observed sampling distribution in our experiments, suggesting that the limitation is architectural rather than optimization-related. Fit time: CTGAN ~2 min CPU; TabDDPM ~6–29 min GPU.

## 5. LLM-Based Synthesis (GReaT)

We evaluate GReaT (Borisov et al., 2023) — which fine-tunes a language model on serialized tabular rows — at two backbone scales: GPT-2 (117M parameters, 2019) and Mistral-7B (7B parameters, 2024). GReaT is tested on three datasets covering two conditions: anonymized features (German Credit) and semantic features under different class balance levels (Hillstrom: extreme imbalance; Telco: balanced).

**Table 3 — GReaT vs CTGAN: AUC gain over baseline ± 95% CI (5 seeds)**

| Dataset | Condition | GPT-2 GReaT | Mistral-7B | CTGAN reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| German Credit | Anonymized, n=100 | −7.02 ± 3.33 pts | −5.59 ± 5.31 pts | +0.27 pts |
| German Credit | Anonymized, n=500 | −3.00 ± 1.90 pts | −0.38 ± 2.52 pts | +0.27 pts |
| Hillstrom | Semantic + extreme imbalance, n=50 | +2.25 ± 4.69 pts | —† | +5.75 pts |
| Hillstrom | Semantic + extreme imbalance, n=100 | +1.15 ± 5.25 pts | +1.20 ± 5.99 pts‡ | +5.75 pts |
| Hillstrom | Semantic + extreme imbalance, n=2000 | **−6.87 ± 4.61 pts** | −1.45 ± 4.35 pts | +5.75 pts |
| Telco | Semantic + balanced, n=100 | −1.38 ± 3.44 pts | −2.15 ± 3.43 pts | +0.28 pts |

†n=50 Mistral-7B on Hillstrom: 4/5 seeds failed to generate parseable rows (extreme imbalance + very small n). ‡Only 3 valid seeds; 2 seeds failed entirely.

Three findings emerge. First, on anonymized features (German Credit), both LLM scales hurt consistently — the LLM prior is inapplicable when feature names carry no semantic meaning. Second, on Hillstrom with extreme imbalance, GReaT at large n actively harms performance (GPT-2: −6.87 pts at n=2,000, d_z=−4.40, FDR-significant, p=0.006) — LLM-generated rows at 0.9% positive rate dilute rather than enrich the minority class as n grows. Third, Mistral-7B is marginally less harmful than GPT-2 on German Credit at large n (−0.38 vs −3.00 pts at n=500), but on Hillstrom and Telco both models underperform the baseline in most conditions. Neither LLM scale approaches CTGAN on the extreme-imbalance datasets that matter for marketing.

The architectural explanation connects to Table 2: GReaT, like TabDDPM, samples from the joint distribution without minority-class conditioning. The observed synthetic positive rate from GReaT would mirror the training distribution (~0.9% on Hillstrom) regardless of whether the backbone is GPT-2 or Mistral-7B. Scaling the LLM does not change this sampling property.

## 6. Recommendation and Limitations

**Practitioner guidance:**

| Positive rate | Observed pattern | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| > 10% | No generator exceeded +0.27 pts | Skip augmentation |
| 1%–10% | **Not tested in this study** | Validate experimentally |
| 0.5%–1% | CTGAN/SMOTE +5–6 pts | Evaluate CTGAN at α ∈ {0.1, 0.3} |
| < 0.5% | CTGAN/SMOTE +12–13 pts | Strongly consider CTGAN |

**Limitations:** (1) Only two extreme-imbalance datasets tested (Hillstrom, Criteo); the 1%–10% transition region is unsampled. (2) All experiments cap at n=10,000; at full dataset scale the minority-example budget is larger and gains may diminish. (3) Generator hyperparameters use library defaults; tuned TabDDPM may narrow the CTGAN gap. (4) Privacy and operational costs not evaluated.

**Future direction — context-conditioned LLM synthesis.** Our LLM results use GReaT, which fine-tunes on serialized rows and samples *unconditionally*; the null effect of scaling (GPT-2 → Mistral-7B) suggests added prior knowledge alone cannot overcome unconditional sampling under extreme imbalance. A different lever is untested here: prompting an instruction-tuned LLM to generate **specifically minority-class** rows, supplied in-context with schema-level metadata (marginal statistics, feature correlations, domain semantics, signal sparsity). This reframes the LLM's role from learning the joint to a CTGAN-like conditional generator, and is the form of "context engineering" most likely to close the gap — a hypothesis we leave to future work.
