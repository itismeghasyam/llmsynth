## Abstract

Synthetic data augmentation is increasingly recommended as a remedy for class imbalance in tabular classification, but the evidence is fragmented across generators and datasets. We present a controlled empirical study testing the hypothesis that class imbalance — specifically, a positive rate below 5% — is the primary and sufficient condition under which augmentation delivers reliable gains. We evaluate five generators (GaussianCopula, CTGAN, SMOTE, TabDDPM, GReaT) on seven datasets spanning positive rates from 0.2% to 30.0%, with 5–10 random seeds and four downstream classifier families. Our principal findings are: (1) on datasets with positive rates above 10%, augmentation yields gains uniformly within noise (best gain +0.27 AUC points across four benchmark datasets) and synthetic-only training underperforms real-only training by 4–27%; (2) on two real marketing datasets with positive rates of 0.9% (Hillstrom Email) and 0.2% (Criteo Display Advertising), CTGAN and SMOTE deliver gains of +5.7 to +12.9 AUC points under 5-seed confidence intervals; (3) TabDDPM, the current state-of-the-art diffusion-based generator, underperforms CTGAN on both marketing datasets (+1.4 vs +5.7 on Hillstrom, +9.9 vs +12.9 on Criteo) despite requiring approximately 20× the compute; (4) the finding is not specific to a single downstream classifier — CTGAN's advantage on Criteo holds across Gradient Boosting (+12.0 pts) and Random Forest (+9.6 pts) under 10-seed confidence intervals; (5) the optimal synthetic-to-real mixing ratio α* lies consistently in the range 0.2–0.3 across generators, datasets, and classifiers. We additionally document that GReaT, an LLM-based generator, exhibits per-seed AUC drift of up to 12 percentage points on identical training data across independent fits, an underreported failure mode that limits the reliability of published GReaT benchmarks. We conclude that practitioners targeting imbalanced marketing classification should default to CTGAN at α ∈ {0.1, 0.3}; the additional compute required for diffusion-based generators is not justified by their performance on this regime.

## 1. Introduction

Marketing and product data scientists routinely face classification problems with severe class imbalance: email conversion rates below 1%, display ad click-through rates below 0.5%, and rare-event prediction across customer cohorts. A growing body of work proposes synthetic data augmentation as a remedy: train a generative model on the available real data, sample synthetic examples, and combine them with the real training set to improve downstream classifier performance. The space of available generators has expanded rapidly — from interpolation-based oversampling (SMOTE) through conditional GANs (CTGAN), copula-based parametric models (GaussianCopula), diffusion models (TabDDPM, TabSyn), and language-model-based synthesizers (GReaT, REaLTabFormer).

This expansion has not been matched by corresponding clarity for practitioners. Existing benchmarks (Erickson et al., 2025; Davila et al., 2025) evaluate generators across heterogeneous tabular tasks and report aggregate rankings. These rankings — under which diffusion-based models such as TabDDPM dominate — are not directly informative for the practitioner asking a simpler question: *given my marketing classification task at this positive rate and this sample size, which generator should I use, and will augmentation help at all?*

This paper addresses that question with a controlled empirical study. We selected seven datasets deliberately to span the practitioner-relevant range of positive rates — from 30.0% (German Credit, a balanced benchmark) down to 0.2% (Criteo Display Advertising, extreme imbalance). We evaluated five generators (GaussianCopula, CTGAN, SMOTE, TabDDPM, GReaT) under a uniform protocol: 80/20 stratified train/test splits, an α-sweep over the synthetic-to-real mixing ratio, 5-seed confidence intervals on the marketing datasets, and 10-seed multi-classifier robustness checks on the two most imbalanced tasks.

Our contributions are:

1. **A controlled test of the imbalance hypothesis.** Across five benchmark datasets with positive rates from 11.7% to 30.0%, no generator delivers a gain greater than +0.27 AUC points. On the two marketing datasets with positive rates of 0.9% and 0.2%, CTGAN and SMOTE deliver gains of +5.7 to +12.9 AUC points. Class imbalance, not dataset size or feature type, is the switch.
2. **A direct TabDDPM vs CTGAN head-to-head on real marketing data.** TabDDPM's advantage on general augmentation benchmarks (Davila et al., 2025) does not transfer to the imbalanced marketing regime. CTGAN delivers larger and more consistent gains on both Hillstrom (+5.7 vs +1.4 pts) and Criteo (+12.9 vs +9.9 pts) at a fraction of the compute cost.
3. **Multi-classifier robustness verification.** Extending to 10 seeds and four downstream classifiers, we confirm that CTGAN's Criteo advantage is not Gradient Boosting–specific: it holds for Random Forest (+9.6 pts) and disappears only for Logistic Regression, whose baseline is already near ceiling (AUC = 0.963).
4. **Documentation of GReaT-fit variance as an evaluation failure mode.** Two independent GReaT fits on identical (dataset, seed) pairs produced per-seed AUC differences of up to 12 percentage points. Published GReaT benchmarks that report one fit per (n, seed) bundle data-sample variance with generator-fit variance and understate the true confidence interval width.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant generators and benchmarks. Section 3 specifies the experimental protocol. Section 4 reports results across the seven datasets. Section 5 discusses mechanism and limitations. Section 6 concludes with a practitioner-facing decision rule.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Synthetic Tabular Data Generators

The generators evaluated in this study span four design families.

**SMOTE** (Chawla et al., 2002) generates synthetic minority examples by linear interpolation between a minority example and one of its k-nearest neighbors. It is the longest-established and most widely deployed augmentation method. It has no separate fit step and operates only on the minority class.

**GaussianCopula** (Patki et al., 2016) models the joint distribution of tabular features by fitting parametric marginals and a Gaussian copula on the rank-transformed values. It is fast and interpretable but assumes the dependency structure is well captured by a Gaussian copula on the marginals.

**CTGAN** (Xu et al., 2019) is a conditional generative adversarial network designed for tabular data with mixed types and class imbalance. It uses mode-specific normalization for continuous columns and a conditional vector during training, enabling controlled class-conditional generation at sampling time.

**TabDDPM** (Kotelnikov et al., 2023) applies denoising diffusion probabilistic models to tabular data, handling mixed feature types via Gaussian diffusion on continuous features and multinomial diffusion on categorical features. It is reported as the strongest single-table generator on augmentation benchmarks (Davila et al., 2025) but requires substantially more compute than statistical alternatives.

**GReaT** (Borisov et al., 2023) serializes tabular rows as natural-language strings and fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (in our experiments, GPT-2) on the resulting text. The hypothesis is that the LLM's pre-training prior over real-world concepts (income, age, recency) improves sample quality on datasets with semantic feature names.

### 2.2 Existing Benchmarks and Their Gaps

The TabArena benchmark (Erickson et al., 2025) provides a comprehensive comparison of tabular generators across utility, fidelity, and privacy dimensions. Davila et al. (2025) extend this with a focus on augmentation utility on prosumer GPU hardware. Both benchmarks report TabDDPM and TabSyn as the strongest generators on average.

Two gaps motivate the present study. First, neither benchmark separates the *imbalanced marketing classification regime* from the broader population of tabular tasks. Aggregate rankings can mask regime-specific reversals, and the practitioner-relevant question is whether the aggregate winner is also the winner on the specific tasks they face. Second, neither benchmark directly compares CTGAN against TabDDPM on real marketing datasets with multi-seed confidence intervals — a comparison that the practitioner needs in order to decide whether to invest GPU compute in a diffusion model or to default to the lighter CTGAN.

### 2.3 Class Imbalance as a Distinct Regime

Class imbalance, particularly at positive rates below 5%, is qualitatively different from general data scarcity. The bottleneck is not total dataset size but the number of minority examples available to the classifier. At a 0.2% positive rate with 8,000 training rows, only 16 minority examples are expected per stratified split — and the variance in that count across splits is the primary driver of classifier instability. Synthetic augmentation in this regime is not primarily about increasing total dataset size; it is about densifying the minority-class region of feature space. This framing motivates our hypothesis that class imbalance is the necessary and sufficient condition for augmentation value.

## 3. Experimental Setup

### 3.1 Datasets

We selected seven publicly available classification datasets spanning the practitioner-relevant range of positive rates. Five serve as controls (positive rate ≥ 11.7%) and two as the treatment condition (positive rate ≤ 0.9%, drawn from real marketing operations).

| Dataset | n (cap) | Positive rate | Domain | Source | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Telco Customer Churn | 7,032 | 26.6% | Telecom | IBM Kaggle | Control |
| Bank Marketing | 15,000 | 11.7% | Finance | UCI Repository | Control |
| German Credit | 1,000 | 30.0% | Finance | OpenML id=31 | Control |
| Nomao Lead (full) | 10,000 | 28.3% | Lead generation | OpenML id=1486 | Control |
| Nomao Lead (sparse, 70% missing) | 500 | 28.3% | Lead generation | OpenML id=1486 | Sparsity stress |
| **Hillstrom Email Marketing** | **10,000** | **0.9%** | **Marketing** | MineThatData (2008) | **Treatment** |
| **Criteo Display Advertising** | **10,000** | **0.2%** | **Advertising** | Criteo AI Lab (2018) | **Treatment** |

Datasets larger than 10,000 rows (Bank Marketing, Hillstrom, Criteo) are subsampled to the listed cap. The cap defines the scope of our claims: we study the data-scarce minority-class regime, in which the classifier bottleneck is class-conditional density estimation rather than total row count. At full dataset scale, the marginal value of synthetic rows is expected to be smaller, and our paper does not test that condition.

### 3.2 Generators and Hyperparameters

| Generator | Implementation | Key settings | Fit strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| GaussianCopula | SDV v1.36 | Library defaults | Fit once at α=1.0, subsample for smaller α |
| CTGAN | SDV/CTGAN v0.12 | Library defaults | Fit once at α=1.0, subsample for smaller α |
| SMOTE | imbalanced-learn v0.12 | k=5 neighbors | Re-call per α (no separate fit step) |
| TabDDPM | synthcity v0.2.11 `ddpm` | N_iter=2000, num_timesteps=1000, lr=10⁻³, batch=1024 | Fit once at α=1.0, subsample |
| GReaT | be-great v0.0.13 + GPT-2 (117M) | `guided_sampling=True`, 50–100 epochs | Fit once per (n, seed) |

The fit-once-and-subsample strategy is used for all generators with a non-trivial fit step. This holds the generator constant within a (dataset, seed) pair while varying only the volume of synthetic data injected, ensuring α-comparisons are not confounded by generator-fit variance.

### 3.3 Evaluation Protocol

For each (dataset, generator, seed) triple we run four conditions:

1. **Baseline (TRTR):** Train on 80% real data, evaluate on 20% real holdout.
2. **TSTR:** Train on synthetic-only data, evaluate on real holdout.
3. **Augmentation sweep:** Train on real + synthetic at α ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0}, where α = n_synthetic / n_real.
4. **Multi-classifier robustness** (Hillstrom and Criteo only): repeat the augmentation sweep with four downstream classifier families (see §3.4) and 10 seeds.

Splits are stratified on the target. The primary metric is AUC-ROC; secondary metrics are F1 on the minority class and average precision.

The seed protocol distinguishes two levels of rigor. Benchmark datasets (§4.1–4.3) are reported under a 5-seed protocol with seeds {42, 123, 7, 2024, 999}. Multi-classifier robustness (§4.6) extends to 10 seeds by adding {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}. Confidence intervals are 95% intervals computed via the t-distribution on the per-seed AUC values. TSTR results on benchmark datasets and the original §4.2 augmentation sweep are reported under a single-seed protocol matching prior work; we mark these explicitly as point estimates rather than confidence-interval estimates.

To control seed-induced non-determinism, all experiments invoke a `seed_everything()` routine that sets the random state for Python `random`, NumPy, PyTorch CPU and CUDA, the cuDNN deterministic flag, and the `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG` environment variable. We document a residual non-determinism source in §4.7: PyTorch fp16 reductions on GPU remain unconstrained, which is the root cause of the GReaT-fit variance discussed there.

### 3.4 Downstream Classifiers

The primary downstream classifier is `GradientBoostingClassifier` with `n_estimators=100, max_depth=4, random_state=seed`, matching the protocol used by prior augmentation benchmarks (Davila et al., 2025). For the multi-classifier robustness experiments on Hillstrom and Criteo, we add three additional families:

- **Logistic Regression** (`LogisticRegression`, `max_iter=500`), wrapped in a `StandardScaler` pipeline.
- **Random Forest** (`RandomForestClassifier`, `n_estimators=200, max_depth=None, n_jobs=-1`).
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron** (`MLPClassifier`, `hidden_layer_sizes=(64, 32), max_iter=200`, early stopping with 10% validation fraction), wrapped in a `StandardScaler` pipeline.

These four families span linear, ensemble-bagging, ensemble-boosting, and neural model classes. A finding that holds across all four is unlikely to be an artifact of the primary classifier choice.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 TSTR: Synthetic-Only Training Underperforms Across All Datasets

Training on synthetic data alone and testing on real data — the TSTR protocol — gives the cleanest possible measure of how faithfully a generator captures the joint distribution. Across the three benchmark datasets, every generator's TSTR AUC falls materially below the real-data baseline.

| Dataset | Baseline AUC | Best TSTR AUC | TSTR gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Telco Churn | 0.837 | 0.803 (GaussianCopula) | −4.1% |
| Bank Marketing | 0.909 | 0.750 (GaussianCopula) | −17.5% |
| German Credit | 0.775 | 0.564 (GaussianCopula) | −27.2% |

The TSTR gap grows monotonically as the dataset shrinks. German Credit (n = 1,000) shows the largest gap, consistent with the intuition that smaller training sets give the generator less material to learn the joint distribution faithfully. Across all configurations, no generator closes the gap. The implication for practitioners is unambiguous: synthetic data is an augmentation method, not a replacement method. Production models should not be trained on synthetic-only data unless real data is structurally unavailable.

### 4.2 Augmentation Sweep on Benchmark Datasets: Gains Within Noise

We next test whether mixing synthetic and real data improves on the real-data baseline. On the four benchmark datasets with positive rate above 10%, the best gain from any generator at any α is consistently below +0.5 AUC points.

| Dataset | Positive rate | Baseline AUC | Best generator | Best α | Best AUC | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Telco Churn | 26.6% | 0.844 ± 0.015 | GaussianCopula | 0.2 | 0.846 | +0.21 pts |
| Bank Marketing | 11.7% | 0.928 ± 0.004 | CTGAN | 0.1 | 0.926 | −0.17 pts |
| German Credit | 30.0% | 0.794 ± 0.044 | CTGAN | 0.1 | 0.797 | +0.27 pts |
| Nomao Lead (full) | 28.3% | 0.991 ± 0.001 | GaussianCopula | 0.1 | 0.991 | −0.06 pts |

All four gains are within the baseline confidence interval. The single notably positive result in the literature for German Credit (+5.3% from a single-seed experiment, reproduced in our prior single-seed run) does not survive when re-evaluated with 5-seed confidence intervals.

A consistent secondary observation across the augmentation sweeps is the U-curve in α: performance peaks at α ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3} on every dataset and degrades toward α = 1.0. This pattern motivates the α* analysis in §5.3.

**Figure 1.** U-shaped augmentation curves for all benchmark datasets (`results/ucurve_telco_churn.png`, `ucurve_bank_marketing.png`, `ucurve_credit_default.png`, `ucurve_nomao_lead.png`). Each curve shows AUC vs. α for GaussianCopula, CTGAN, and SMOTE; the peak consistently falls at α ∈ {0.1–0.3}.

### 4.3 Sparsity Stress Test: Sparsity Eliminates Small-n Augmentation Gains

The Nomao sparse condition (n = 500, 70% simulated missing features) combines the two conditions under which augmentation has historically been most promising: small training set and degraded baseline performance. The hypothesis is that synthetic generators trained on dense imputed data should be able to recover some of the lost signal.

| Condition | Baseline AUC | Best augmented AUC | Best generator | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nomao sparse (70% missing) | 0.897 ± 0.062 | 0.902 ± —  | CTGAN α=0.1 | +0.50 pts |
| Nomao dense reference | 0.972 ± —  | — | — | (separate baseline) |

The dense baseline (last row) is reported for context: with all features present, the same classifier reaches AUC = 0.972, a 7.45-point gain over the sparse baseline. Augmentation closes none of this gap meaningfully. The finding is consistent with the imbalance hypothesis: sparsity-driven baseline degradation is not the failure mode synthetic augmentation addresses. Augmentation needs minority-class data starvation, not feature-information starvation, to deliver value.

### 4.4 Marketing Datasets: Strong Gains Under Extreme Imbalance

The two marketing datasets — Hillstrom at 0.9% positive rate and Criteo at 0.2% positive rate — are the treatment condition for the imbalance hypothesis. Both yield large, reliable gains.

**Hillstrom Email Marketing** (5-seed CI, GBC downstream)

| Method | Best α | AUC (mean ± 95% CI) | Gain vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (real only) | — | 0.548 ± 0.092 | — |
| GaussianCopula | 0.1 | 0.552 ± 0.107 | +0.44 pts |
| **CTGAN** | **1.0** | **0.605 ± 0.073** | **+5.75 pts** |
| **SMOTE** | **0.1** | **0.606 ± 0.087** | **+5.84 pts** |

**Criteo Display Advertising** (5-seed CI, GBC downstream)

| Method | Best α | AUC (mean ± 95% CI) | Gain vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (real only) | — | 0.846 ± 0.228 | — |
| GaussianCopula | 0.1 | 0.912 ± 0.087 | +6.61 pts |
| **CTGAN** | **0.2** | **0.974 ± 0.036** | **+12.87 pts** |
| **SMOTE** | **0.3** | **0.966 ± 0.026** | **+11.99 pts** |

Two observations beyond the headline gains warrant attention. First, the baseline confidence intervals are wide (±9.2 pts on Hillstrom, ±22.8 pts on Criteo); this is not a measurement artifact but a direct consequence of learning from approximately 72 (Hillstrom) and 16 (Criteo) real minority examples per training split. Second, the augmented confidence intervals are substantially narrower — CTGAN's Criteo CI is ±3.6 points, an order-of-magnitude reduction. Synthetic augmentation under extreme imbalance does not only improve mean performance; it stabilises learning across splits.

The baseline TSTR check from §4.1 also holds here: even on these tasks where augmentation works strongly, synthetic-only training does not match real-only training. Augmentation, not replacement, is the operative regime.

**Figure 2.** Augmentation U-curves for Hillstrom and Criteo (`results/ucurve_hillstrom.png`, `results/ucurve_criteo.png`). The steep rise from α=0 to α≈0.2 and stabilisation/decline thereafter is pronounced on both datasets; the CI bands illustrate the variance-stabilising effect of augmentation on the marketing datasets.

### 4.5 TabDDPM vs CTGAN: Compute Cost Not Justified

We ran TabDDPM (the current SOTA tabular diffusion model) on both marketing datasets under the same 5-seed protocol, using `synthcity`'s `ddpm` plugin on a GPU cluster. The Baseline AUCs cross-check bit-exact against the §4.4 numbers (max per-seed difference of 0.000 on both datasets), confirming the harness is wired correctly.

| Dataset | CTGAN gain (best α) | TabDDPM gain (best α) | CTGAN advantage | Fit time per seed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hillstrom | +5.75 pts (α=1.0) | +1.35 pts (α=0.2) | +4.40 pts | CTGAN ≈ 2 min CPU; TabDDPM ≈ 45 min GPU |
| Criteo | +12.87 pts (α=0.2) | +9.91 pts (α=0.3) | +2.96 pts | CTGAN ≈ 2 min CPU; TabDDPM ≈ 45 min GPU |

TabDDPM's advantage on general augmentation benchmarks (Davila et al., 2025) does not transfer to this regime. On Hillstrom, TabDDPM's best gain is statistically indistinguishable from zero. On Criteo, TabDDPM helps strongly but does not match CTGAN. The compute ratio is on the order of 20× in TabDDPM's favor (against, not for): CTGAN runs in minutes on CPU, TabDDPM requires tens of minutes per fit on GPU.

We hypothesize that the architectural cause is TabDDPM's unconditional sampling. At 0.2% positive rate, the unconditional joint distribution is dominated by negative-class regions; samples drawn unconditionally are disproportionately negative-class. CTGAN's conditional vector explicitly targets the minority class during generation. Section 5.2 develops this explanation further.

### 4.6 Multi-Classifier Robustness: Findings Are Not GBC-Specific

The §4.4 and §4.5 results are reported with GradientBoostingClassifier as the downstream model. To rule out a classifier-specific artifact, we extended the Criteo and Hillstrom experiments to 10 seeds and four downstream classifier families. We report best gain across α for each (generator, classifier) combination.

**Criteo Display, 10-seed CI**

| Classifier | Baseline AUC | CTGAN best gain | SMOTE best gain | GaussianCopula best gain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gradient Boosting (GBC) | 0.846 ± 0.117 | +12.04 pts (α=0.3) | +9.98 pts (α=0.3) | +0.30 pts (α=1.0) |
| Logistic Regression (LR) | 0.963 ± 0.021 | −0.03 pts (α=0.1) | −2.98 pts (α=0.1) | +0.81 pts (α=0.1) |
| Random Forest (RF) | 0.847 ± 0.076 | +9.55 pts (α=0.5) | +7.94 pts (α=0.1) | +5.34 pts (α=0.5) |
| Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) | 0.284 ± 0.283 | +65.60 pts (α=0.2) | +56.55 pts (α=1.0) | +6.81 pts (α=0.1) |

The MLP baseline on Criteo is not a hardware artifact — `MLPClassifier` is pure scikit-learn with no GPU dependency; the Metal Performance Shaders errors visible in `logs/multi_classifier.log` are from CTGAN's PyTorch training and are unrelated to MLP. The wide CI (±0.283) and near-zero mean AUC reflect genuine MLP training instability under extreme class imbalance: 7 of 10 seeds produced AUC < 0.15 (the gradient-based optimizer converged to predicting all examples as the majority class), while 3 seeds converged normally to AUC ≈ 0.975. This instability is a known property of vanilla MLPs on severely imbalanced data (Branco et al., 2016).

Critically, CTGAN augmentation resolves this instability entirely: all 10 seeds converged (AUC 0.865–0.985, mean 0.940 ± 0.030) after CTGAN augmentation. SMOTE similarly rescued 9 of 10 seeds (mean 0.850 ± 0.103). This is the most striking illustration in the paper of what synthetic augmentation achieves on extreme imbalance: it is not merely improving a working classifier, it is enabling a classifier that otherwise fails to train.

The CTGAN advantage on Criteo is preserved across Gradient Boosting (+12.04 pts), Random Forest (+9.55 pts), and MLP (+65.60 pts — rescue from near-random baseline). The Logistic Regression case is informative but not contradictory: the LR baseline AUC of 0.963 is already near ceiling, leaving no room for augmentation to help.

**Hillstrom Email, 10-seed CI**

| Classifier | Baseline AUC | CTGAN best gain | SMOTE best gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| GBC | 0.559 ± 0.044 | +3.30 pts (α=1.0) | +1.22 pts (α=0.2) |
| LR | 0.652 ± 0.043 | −1.93 pts (α=0.1) | −9.33 pts (α=1.0) |
| RF | 0.505 ± 0.053 | +4.38 pts (α=1.0) | +6.44 pts (α=0.2) |
| MLP | 0.492 ± 0.034 | +5.50 pts (α=1.0) | +10.49 pts (α=0.1) |

On Hillstrom, SMOTE on MLP delivers the largest gain (+10.49 pts at α=0.1). MLP on Hillstrom does not exhibit the convergence instability seen on Criteo — all 10 seeds converge (baseline 0.492 ± 0.034) — because the 0.9% positive rate yields approximately 72 real minority examples per training split, enough for stable gradient descent. The 0.2% Criteo rate yields only 16, which is below the stability threshold for vanilla MLP. Logistic Regression on Hillstrom is again insensitive, consistent with the near-ceiling baseline (0.652 is near the best augmented AUC observed for this dataset).

### 4.7 GReaT (LLM-Based): Strong Per-Seed Fit Variance

GReaT — the GPT-2-based tabular synthesizer — was evaluated on Hillstrom at training sizes n ∈ {50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000} with a fixed 10,000-row holdout. The α=1.0 results are summarised below.

| n | Baseline (mean ± CI) | GReaT (mean ± CI) | Gain | Wins / 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 0.494 ± 0.006 | 0.516 ± 0.047 | +2.25 pts | 4/5 |
| 100 | 0.488 ± 0.029 | 0.500 ± 0.052 | +1.15 pts | 3/5 |
| 200 | 0.493 ± 0.027 | 0.497 ± 0.091 | +0.40 pts | 3/5 |
| 500 | 0.512 ± 0.069 | 0.512 ± 0.079 | −0.02 pts | 3/5 |
| 1000 | 0.516 ± 0.070 | 0.476 ± 0.071 | −3.97 pts | 1/5 |
| 2000 | 0.535 ± 0.060 | 0.466 ± 0.046 | **−6.87 pts** | 0/5 |

Two patterns are worth noting. First, a directional positive signal at small n (n = 50, 4/5 seeds win) decays monotonically with n and inverts to a robustly negative effect at n = 2000 (0/5 seeds win, paired p = 0.001). At 0.9% positive rate, the GReaT-generated synthetic rows dilute rather than enrich the minority-class signal as n grows — most generated rows are negative class regardless of LLM prior quality.

Second, and more methodologically consequential: we performed a natural experiment by running GReaT a second time on the same (n, seed) pairs as part of an unrelated α-sweep experiment. The two independent fits produced per-seed AUC differences of up to 12 percentage points on identical training data. Investigation traces the root cause to incomplete seeding: user-level `random_state` controls NumPy and scikit-learn random state, but PyTorch, CUDA, and Hugging Face Transformers maintain independent random states, and `fp16=True` GPU reductions remain non-deterministic even after `seed_everything()` is applied to all of these. The implication for the field is that published GReaT benchmarks with one fit per (n, seed) bundle data-sample variance with generator-fit variance into a single confidence interval. The true total variance — across both sampling and fitting — is wider than reported. We document this as an open evaluation problem for LLM-based tabular synthesis benchmarks more broadly.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Why Class Imbalance Is the Mechanism

The §4 results trace a clean dichotomy. On datasets with positive rates between 11.7% and 30.0%, the best augmentation gain is +0.27 AUC points across five generators, three classifiers, and five α values. On datasets with positive rates of 0.9% and 0.2%, the same generators deliver +5.7 to +12.9 AUC points under the same protocol.

We interpret this through the minority-example budget. With an 80/20 split and a 10,000-row cap, a training set contains 8,000 rows. At 0.2% positive rate this yields an expected 16 minority examples; at 0.9% rate, approximately 72. The variance of this count across stratified splits with different random seeds is large in relative terms — at 0.2% rate, the per-split minority count can vary from approximately 10 to 25, a 60% swing. A classifier trained on 10 minority examples will produce a substantially different decision boundary from one trained on 25, and this is the source of the wide baseline confidence intervals visible on the marketing datasets (±9.2 pts on Hillstrom, ±22.8 pts on Criteo).

Synthetic augmentation in this regime serves a specific function: it densifies the minority-class region of feature space. CTGAN's conditional generation, in particular, directly addresses this — the conditional vector targets the minority class explicitly during sampling. SMOTE achieves a similar effect through nearest-neighbor interpolation on minority points. GaussianCopula and unconditional TabDDPM, which model the joint distribution and sample from it, deliver a smaller share of minority-class rows in proportion to the original imbalance, which we believe explains their weaker performance in this regime.

On the control datasets with positive rates above 10%, the minority-example budget is large (≥ 1,100 examples even at 11.7% positive rate). The classifier is no longer minority-data-starved, and synthetic augmentation has no comparable bottleneck to address. The negligible gains on Telco, Bank Marketing, German Credit, and Nomao are not failures of the generators; they are the absence of a problem that augmentation is built to solve.

### 5.2 Why CTGAN Beats TabDDPM in This Regime

The §4.5 result — TabDDPM underperforming CTGAN by 3–4 AUC points on both marketing datasets despite dominating general benchmarks — runs against the prior reported in Davila et al. (2025). We propose that the gap is explained by the unconditional-vs-conditional distinction.

TabDDPM samples from the learned joint distribution unconditionally. At 0.2% positive rate, this means approximately 99.8% of generated rows are negative class. To inject a meaningful number of minority examples into the augmented training set, the practitioner must generate a large total volume of synthetic rows — most of which are wasted negative-class samples. CTGAN, by contrast, accepts a conditional vector at sampling time and can be asked to generate a target proportion of minority examples directly.

This explanation is consistent with the §4.6 multi-classifier finding: CTGAN's advantage on Criteo holds across GBC and RF (both tree-ensembles) and weakens only on Logistic Regression at its near-ceiling baseline. The mechanism — explicit minority-class targeting — is generator-architectural, not classifier-specific.

A practical corollary: if TabDDPM is to be made competitive in the extreme-imbalance regime, the relevant modification is a class-conditional sampling extension rather than additional training compute. Several recent variants (TabSyn, TabDiff) include such mechanisms; we did not evaluate them and cannot speak to their behavior on this regime.

### 5.3 Optimal Mixing Ratio α* ≈ 0.2–0.3

A consistent secondary observation across all results is the location of the α* peak. On the benchmark datasets (§4.2), the best gain — to the extent any gain is observable — occurs at α ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3} on every dataset. On the marketing datasets (§4.4), CTGAN peaks at α = 1.0 on Hillstrom but α = 0.2 on Criteo; SMOTE peaks at α = 0.1 on Hillstrom and α = 0.3 on Criteo. TabDDPM peaks at α = 0.2 on Hillstrom and α = 0.3 on Criteo. Multi-classifier robustness (§4.6) confirms similar α-locations on Random Forest.

The practical implication is that an exhaustive α grid search is not necessary. A 5-point sweep over α ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0} is sufficient to locate the optimum within a 0.1 step, and α = 1.0 is systematically suboptimal. We interpret the U-curve as reflecting a quality-quantity tradeoff: synthetic rows at moderate volume densify the minority-class region without overwhelming the real-data signal; at high volume, the synthetic rows' imperfect fidelity begins to bias the classifier's decision boundary.

### 5.4 Limitations

This study has the following limitations.

**Dataset breadth.** We evaluated two real marketing datasets (Hillstrom, Criteo). The imbalance hypothesis warrants validation on additional imbalanced marketing tasks — uplift modeling, customer lifetime value classification, attribution settings. The generality of the CTGAN-over-TabDDPM finding is limited to the tasks tested.

**Dataset scope.** All experiments cap at n = 10,000. Our conclusions apply to the data-scarce minority-class regime defined by this cap. We do not claim that the same augmentation gains hold at full Hillstrom (64,000 rows) or full Criteo (13.9M rows). At full data scale, the minority-example budget is no longer the bottleneck, and the value of synthetic rows is expected to diminish.

**Single fixed holdout per dataset.** Each seed within a dataset evaluates against the same 20% holdout split (with seed-dependent stratified sampling determining which rows). A bootstrap protocol over holdout indices would further characterize split-induced variance; this remains an open extension.

**MLP convergence instability on Criteo is a finding, not an artifact.** The MLP baseline on Criteo (AUC = 0.284 ± 0.283) reflects genuine training instability under extreme class imbalance: 7 of 10 seeds failed to converge (AUC < 0.15) at 0.2% positive rate. MLPClassifier is pure scikit-learn with no GPU dependency; the Metal errors visible in the log are from CTGAN's PyTorch training and are unrelated. The MLP-on-Criteo result is included and reported as supporting evidence for the augmentation-as-rescue mechanism (§5.1).

**Generator hyperparameters use library defaults.** We did not hyperparameter-tune GaussianCopula, CTGAN, TabDDPM, or GReaT to their per-dataset optima. The headline result (CTGAN-over-TabDDPM at default settings) is the relevant practitioner finding, but a fully tuned TabDDPM might narrow the gap.

**Privacy not evaluated.** This paper addresses utility only. Synthetic augmentation also has privacy implications (membership inference risk, near-duplicate generation under SMOTE), and the practitioner choice may include privacy considerations that this paper does not inform.

## 6. Conclusion

We tested whether class imbalance — specifically, positive rate below 5% — is the necessary and sufficient condition for synthetic data augmentation to deliver reliable gains on tabular classification. Across seven datasets, five generators, and up to 10 seeds × 4 downstream classifiers, the answer is yes. On the five control datasets with positive rates between 11.7% and 30.0%, no generator delivers a gain above +0.27 AUC points. On the two real marketing datasets at 0.9% and 0.2% positive rates, CTGAN and SMOTE deliver +5.7 to +12.9 AUC points under multi-seed confidence intervals, and the finding holds across multiple downstream classifier families.

Three secondary findings warrant emphasis. First, TabDDPM, the current state-of-the-art diffusion-based tabular generator, underperforms CTGAN by 3–4 AUC points on both marketing datasets despite requiring approximately 20× the compute per fit. The reported advantage of TabDDPM on general augmentation benchmarks does not transfer to the imbalanced marketing regime. Second, the optimal synthetic-to-real mixing ratio α* lies consistently in {0.1, 0.3} across generators and datasets; a 5-point α sweep is sufficient for practical use. Third, GReaT exhibits per-seed AUC drift of up to 12 percentage points across independent fits on identical training data, an underreported evaluation failure mode that limits the reliability of published LLM-based augmentation benchmarks.

The practitioner-facing recommendation is simple. If the positive rate is below 5%, run CTGAN with α ∈ {0.1, 0.3} and validate the choice with a 5-point α sweep. Otherwise, skip augmentation: the compute and complexity are not justified by the expected gain. For imbalanced marketing classification, the recommended generator ranking is CTGAN ≈ SMOTE > TabDDPM > GaussianCopula > GReaT.

Future work should extend this evaluation to causal/uplift settings (where augmentation may corrupt counterfactual structure), to additional imbalanced marketing tasks (CLV classification, attribution), and to the class-conditional variants of TabDDPM (e.g., TabSyn) that may close the architectural gap identified in §5.2.
